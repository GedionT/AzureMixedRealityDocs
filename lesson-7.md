# Lesson 7

## Concepts

### What is a Spatial Anchor?

 Spatial Anchors allows you to place virtual object in a specific place in your real world. Spatial Anchors are available in iOS, Android and HoloLens headsets. [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/overview?WT.mc_id=talksAndWorkshops-github-ayyonet) gives you a way to save and share anchor points in space, so that you can share the virtual objects or information between multiple devices and persist them over time.

### Why use Spatial Anchors? 

Using [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/overview?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) allow you to share any information in specific context, time and space. Some of the use cases are having user guides of machinery, inventory information, [way-finding applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/concepts/anchor-relationships-way-finding?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet), educational applications, multi-player games. Having smartphones and having access to the GPS data changed the apps we build and enabled ride sharing and location based recommendation applications. Developing with Azure Spatial Anchors will help you deliver contextual data at the right time and place and will open up new possibilities indoors.

###  **Which devices does Azure Spatial Anchors support?**

Azure Spatial Anchors enables developers to build apps on [HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/quickstarts/get-started-hololens?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet), on[ iOS ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/quickstarts/get-started-ios?tabs=openproject-swift&WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet)devices with ARKit support, and on [Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/quickstarts/get-started-android?tabs=openproject-java&WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) devices with ARCore support; for iOS and Android this includes both phones and tablets. 

### What do I need to do to make sure Android, iOS and HoloLens are using the same point as my anchor?

[To share Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/tutorials/tutorial-share-anchors-across-devices?tabs=VS%2CAndroid&WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet), SDK translate the local Spatial Anchor data into Azure Spatial Anchor format and saves it. Similarly, when a different platform asks for the same Spatial anchor data, the device will receive the anchor in platform's format. 

## Project

### How to sign up for Azure Student Account?

* Go to [Azure For Students page.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet)
* Follow the Activate Now link.

### How to create an Azure Spatial Anchor resource?

* Go to[ Azure Portal](%20https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet).
* In the left navigation pane in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**.
* Use the search box to search for **Spatial Anchors**.

![Azure Portal Search for Spatial Anchor](.gitbook/assets/portal-search.png)

* Select **Spatial Anchors**. In the dialog box, select **Create**.
* In the **Spatial Anchors Account** dialog box:
  * Enter a unique resource name, using regular alphanumeric characters.
  * Select the subscription that you want to attach the resource to.
  * Create a resource group by selecting **Create new**. Name it **myResourceGroup** and select **OK**. A [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#terminology?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) is a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed. For example, you can choose to delete the entire resource group in one simple step later.
  * Select a location \(region\) in which to place the resource.
  * Select **New** to begin creating the resource.
*  After the resource is created, Azure Portal will show that your deployment is complete. Click **Go to resource**.

![When deployment is complete, select go to resources.](.gitbook/assets/deployment-complete.png)

*  Then, you can view the resource properties. Copy the resource's **Account ID** value into a text editor because you'll need it later.

![Copy Resource&apos;s Account ID.](.gitbook/assets/view-resource-properties.png)

*  Under **Settings**, select **Key**. Copy the **Primary key** value into a text editor. This value is the `Account Key`. You'll need it later.

### How to create a Azure Spatial Anchor app and configure scene?

* Start your project from [UnitySeedProject](lesson1.md#how-to-get-started-with-hololens-seed-project).
* Work on main scene or[ create a new scene](lesson1.md#how-to-create-a-new-scene) and [configure your scene with MRTK](lesson1.md#how-to-configure-a-new-scene-with-mrtk).
*  In the **Publishing Settings** Configuration section, check **InternetClientServer** and **SpatialPerception**.
* Add Spatial Mapping Collider component to your camera.

![Add Spatial Mapping Collider to camera.](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-158.png)

### How to add ASA script to your scene?

* Create a new script called AzureSpatialAnchorsScript.
* Add imports:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.XR.WSA;
using UnityEngine.XR.WSA.Input;
```

* Add the following members variables into your AzureSpatialAnchorsScript class:

```csharp
public class AzureSpatialAnchorsScript : MonoBehaviour
{   
    /// <summary>
    /// The sphere prefab.
    /// </summary>
    public GameObject spherePrefab;

    /// <summary>
    /// Set this string to the Spatial Anchors account id provided in the Spatial Anchors resource.
    /// </summary>
    protected string SpatialAnchorsAccountId = "Set me";

    /// <summary>
    /// Set this string to the Spatial Anchors account key provided in the Spatial Anchors resource.
    /// </summary>
    protected string SpatialAnchorsAccountKey = "Set me";

    /// <summary>
    /// Use the recognizer to detect air taps.
    /// </summary>
    private GestureRecognizer recognizer;

    /// <summary>
    /// True if we are 1) creating + saving an anchor or 2) looking for an anchor.
    /// </summary>
    protected bool tapExecuted = false;

    /// <summary>
    /// The ID of the CloudSpatialAnchor that was saved. Use it to find the CloudSpatialAnchor
    /// </summary>
    protected string cloudSpatialAnchorId = "";

    /// <summary>
    /// The sphere rendered to show the position of the CloudSpatialAnchor.
    /// </summary>
    protected GameObject sphere;
    protected Material sphereMaterial;

    /// <summary>
    /// Indicate if we are ready to save an anchor. We can save an anchor when value is greater than 1.
    /// </summary>
    protected float recommendedForCreate = 0;
```

### How to initialize a CloudSpatialAnchorSession?

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new CloudSpatialAnchorSession.
/// </summary>
void InitializeSession()
{
    Debug.Log("ASA Info: Initializing a CloudSpatialAnchorSession.");

    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(SpatialAnchorsAccountId))
    {
        Debug.LogError("No account id set.");
        return;
    }

    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(SpatialAnchorsAccountKey))
    {
        Debug.LogError("No account key set.");
        return;
    }

    cloudSpatialAnchorSession = new CloudSpatialAnchorSession();

    cloudSpatialAnchorSession.Configuration.AccountId = SpatialAnchorsAccountId.Trim();
    cloudSpatialAnchorSession.Configuration.AccountKey = SpatialAnchorsAccountKey.Trim();

    cloudSpatialAnchorSession.LogLevel = SessionLogLevel.All;

    cloudSpatialAnchorSession.Error += CloudSpatialAnchorSession_Error;
    cloudSpatialAnchorSession.OnLogDebug += CloudSpatialAnchorSession_OnLogDebug;
    cloudSpatialAnchorSession.SessionUpdated += CloudSpatialAnchorSession_SessionUpdated;

    cloudSpatialAnchorSession.Start();

    Debug.Log("ASA Info: Session was initialized.");
}
```
