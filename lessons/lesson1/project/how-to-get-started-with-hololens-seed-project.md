# How to get started with HoloLens Seed Project?

\*\*\*\*[**HoloLens Seed** project](https://github.com/Yonet/HoloLensUnitySeedProject) is a github repository that is configured for **Windows Mixed Reality development**. The repo includes **Mixed Reality Toolkit** and **.gitignore** files. 

You can create a new project from the seed instead of downloading the different assets and setting up your git project. To be able to use the seed project, you can [get a github account](https://github.com/?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) and setup your development environment or directly download the repository content.
