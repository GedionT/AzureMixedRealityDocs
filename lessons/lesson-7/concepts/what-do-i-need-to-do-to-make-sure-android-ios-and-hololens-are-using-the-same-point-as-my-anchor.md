[To share Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/tutorials/tutorial-share-anchors-across-devices?tabs=VS%2CAndroid&WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet), SDK translate the local Spatial Anchor data into Azure Spatial Anchor format and saves it. Similarly, when a different platform asks for the same Spatial anchor data, the device will receive the anchor in the platform's format.
