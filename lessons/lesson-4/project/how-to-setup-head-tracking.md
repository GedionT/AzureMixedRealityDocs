# How to Setup Head Tracking

The **Main Camera** object tracks the movement of the user's head. You can think of the starting position of the user as x = 0, y = 0, z = 0. When you add and configure **Mixed Reality Toolkit** to your scene, the **Main Camera** object is set at the user's starting position of x = 0, y = 0, z = 0.

Although this is the default position of the **Main Camera** for MRTK, you can view this by expanding the **MixedRealityPlayspace** object in the Hierarchy window and then select the **Main Camera** object.

In the Inspector window, you will see that the **Transform Position** is x = 0, y = 0, z = 0.
