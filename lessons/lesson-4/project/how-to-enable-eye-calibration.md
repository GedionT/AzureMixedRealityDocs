# How to Enable Eye Calibration

For eye tracking to work accurately, each user is required to go through an eye tracking user calibration for which the user has to look at a set of holographic targets. This allows the device to adjust the system for a more comfortable and higher quality viewing experience for the user and to ensure accurate eye tracking at the same time.

Eye tracking should work for most users, but there are rare cases in which a user might not be able to calibrate successfully. Calibration might fail for various reasons, including but not limited to:

- The user previously opted out of the calibration process
- The user got distracted and didn't follow the calibration targets
- The user has certain types of contact lenses and glasses which the system doesn't yet support
- The user has certain eye physiology, eye conditions or had eye surgery which the system doesn't yet support
- External factors inhibiting reliable eye tracking such as smudges on the HoloLens visor or eyeglasses, intense direct sunlight and occlusions due to hair in front of the eyes

Calibrating the HoloLens 2 ensures that it can accurately track your eyes (and the eyes of anyone else who uses the device). After calibration, holograms will appear correctly even as the visor shifts on your head.

HoloLens 2 prompts a user to calibrate the device under the following circumstances:

- The user is using the device for the first time
- The user previously opted out of the calibration process
- The calibration process did not succeed the last time the user used the device
- The user has deleted their calibration profiles

For HoloLens 2, there are two ways to start the eye calibration process:

**Option One**

Flip up the device visor up and then back down. A system notification should appear welcoming you as a new user and will ask you to go through the eye calibration.

**Option Two**

Use the start gesture to open the **Start** menu. Next, Open the **Settings** app. Once there, go to **System** > **Calibration** > **Eye Calibration** > **Run eye calibration**.
