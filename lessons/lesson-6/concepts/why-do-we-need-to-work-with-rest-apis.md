# Why do we need to work with REST APIs?

As mentioned in [What is back-end code?](), there are plenty of times when building a mixed reality app where you might need some code to run on a server.

REST APIs are the standard way to make that happen. If you're using third-party libraries in your application, they may already be making REST API calls under the hood, but often you will need to access web-based APIs by constructing those HTTP requests yourself.
