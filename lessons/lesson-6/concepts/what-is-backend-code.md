### What is "back-end" code?

When building an MR app, most of the code you're writing is designed to be run on your users' Mixed Reality devices. Sometimes, though, you need to run some code on a server. Maybe you're coordinating real-time multiplayer gameplay, or are storing data that you'd like users to be able to share with each other, or need to do some calculations that are particularly complex and need access to more powerful cloud computers.

If your application uses some sort of web servers to do any work, the code that runs on those servers is typically referred to as the "back-end". The code that runs on your Mixed Reality device is the "front-end".
