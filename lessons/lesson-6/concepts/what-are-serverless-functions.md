# What are 'serverless' functions?

Traditionally, running a web server requires you to, well, your own server. That might be a physical computer you own, or something you're renting in a data center, or even a virtual machine being run by a large cloud provider. Conceptually, though, you're still responsible for maintaining all of the software that runs on this server. If your application gets popular enough that your server can't handle the load, you need to figure out how to add more servers to the mix and configure them all to work together to handle the incoming requests. That's a lot of work!

For this chapter's project, we'll be using Azure Functions. They're what's known as "serverless" technology: instead of having to deal with configuring a computer to act as a server, you simply need to provide a single function of code — C# in our case, but most popular languages are supported — and Azure is responsible for figuring out how to put that in a server environment. After you upload your code, you'll be given a URL. Any time a REST API request is made to that URL, your code will run. Because you don't need to worry about how to scale things up if your application gets popular, serverless functions are a great choice for dipping your toes into the world of server-side software development.
