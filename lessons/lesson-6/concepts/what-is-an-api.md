# What is an API?

An **application programming interface** \(**API**\) is a way to interact with other code. We've talked about a number of APIs in this guide — APIs for placing 3D objects in a scene, for AI and ML, for maps — but they've generally been exposed as C# code that you call locally on-device.

An API can also be a web service that exists on a remote server. In this case, we'll be talking about APIs that you communicate with not by calling C# functions, but by making HTTP requests across the network, similar to how your web browser loads a website.
