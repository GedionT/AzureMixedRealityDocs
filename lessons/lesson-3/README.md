# 03 - Hand Interactions and Controllers

## Concepts

### Why the hand interaction is important?

Hand interaction is a very natural way to interact with 3D models.

## Project

### How to add hand interaction to your model using MRTK

### How to grab and move an object?

 To make an object grabbable, assign these two scripts: **ManipulationHandler.cs** and **NearInteractionGrabbable.cs**\(for direct grab with articulated hand tracking input\) ManipulationHandler supports both **near** and **far interactions**. You can grab and move an object with HoloLens 2’s articulated hand tracking input\(near\), hand ray\(far\), motion controller’s beam\(far\), HoloLens gaze cursor & air-tap\(far\).

### To get started we have to add MRTK Manipulation Handler to our 3D object
