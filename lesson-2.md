## Developer Tools

### [How to simulate input interactions in Unity editor](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/InputSimulation/InputSimulationService.html?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet)?

MRTK supports in-editor input simulation. Simply run your scene by clicking Unityâ€™s play button. Use these keys to simulate input.

* Press **W, A, S, D** keys to move the **camera**.
* Hold the **right mouse button** and move the mouse to look around.
* To bring up the **simulated hands**, press **Space bar\(Right hand\)** or **left Shift key\(Left hand\).**
* To keep [**simulated hands**](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/InputSimulation/InputSimulationService.html#hand-simulation?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) in the view, press **T** or **Y** key.
* To **rotate simulated hands**, press **Q** or **E\(horizontal\) / R or F\(vertical\).**
