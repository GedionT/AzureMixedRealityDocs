# Project Accoustic

[Project Accustic ](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/acoustics/what-is-acoustics?WT.mc_id=mrcurriculum-github-ayyonet)is a wave acoustics engine for 3D interactive experiences. It models wave effects like occlusion, obstruction, portaling and reverberation effects in complex scenes without requiring manual zone markup or CPU intensive [raytracing](https://app.gitbook.com/@yonet/s/mixed-reality-docs/core-building-blocks/lighting/raytracing/). It also includes game engine and audio middleware integration.
