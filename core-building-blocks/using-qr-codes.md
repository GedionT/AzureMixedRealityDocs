# Spatial Alignment with QR Codes

## What is a QR Code?

**QR code** \(abbreviated from **Quick Response code**\) is the trademark for a type of [matrix barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_barcode) \(or two-dimensional [barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode)\) first designed in 1994 for the [automotive industry in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Japan). A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached.

Pointing the camera to a Hiro Image allows your device to capture the surface of the image and display a 3D object relative to the marker.
