# Lesson 1

In this lesson, you will learn about the basic concepts about Mixed Reality and explore the applications of Mixed Reality in different industries. 

You will set up your first Mixed Reality project using Unity and Mixed Reality Tool Kit.

You can jump directly into setting up your first project here on the[ How to get started with mixed reality development using Unity3D](lesson1.md#how-to-get-started-with-mixed-reality-development-using-unity) section.
