# How to contribute?

## Ways to contribute.

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

* You can file an issue or add a feature request on the curriculum repository: [https://github.com/Yonet/AzureMixedRealityDocs/issues](https://github.com/Yonet/AzureMixedRealityDocs/issues)
* File an issue for the samples repo: [https://github.com/Yonet/MixedRealityUnitySamples/issues](https://github.com/Yonet/MixedRealityUnitySamples/issues)
* Add to curriculum content: [https://github.com/Yonet/AzureMixedRealityDocs](https://github.com/Yonet/AzureMixedRealityDocs).

### Adding to sample project.

If you have a code sample please either start your code sample from the [HoloLens Seed project](http://bit.ly/HoloLensUnitySeed) or directly  contribute to [Unity Samples repo](http://bit.ly/MixedRealityUnitySamples) by sending a pull request. You can find the installation information in the related repositories. 

### Thank you for being our hero!
