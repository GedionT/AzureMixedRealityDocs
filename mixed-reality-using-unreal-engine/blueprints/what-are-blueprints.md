# What are Blueprints?

 The **Blueprints Visual Scripting** system in Unreal Engine is a complete gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a **node-based** interface to create gameplay elements from within Unreal Editor.

This system is extremely **flexible** and **powerful** as it provides the ability for **designers** to use virtually the full range of concepts and tools generally only available to programmers. 

In addition, **Blueprint-specific markup** available in **Unreal Engine's C++** implementation enables programmers to create baseline systems that can be extended by designers.
