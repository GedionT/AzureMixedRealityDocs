# 3D scene interactions

If you are in a 3D scene on a 2D display, you can interact with the objects or buttons on you scene with a mouse or touch event, as you would in any other web app. One difference is the instead of checking if we hit an html element like button, we need to check the 3D position that we are hitting and check if there is any collisions with an object. We do not have a way to directly attach a touch or click event to a 3D object but we can check to see if the ray casted from our touch or click is passing through an object.
