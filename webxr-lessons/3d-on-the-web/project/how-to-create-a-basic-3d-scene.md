# How to create a basic 3D scene?



To create a basic scene we need to initialize a **scene** object. You can think of a **scene** as a **stage** that will hold your production. Everything that will be visible to the viewer will be added to the scene.

We need to add a **camera** object to the scene that will be our viewers perspective. Anything on the scene but not in the view of the camera won't be visible on your canvas. 

We also need a **light** source for our objects to be visible. 

Finally, we will create a basic shape\(**mesh**\), box. 

Let's create the basic scene using different libraries.
