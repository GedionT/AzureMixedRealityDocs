# How to create an application with AI whiteout coding?

You might have an idea for an application using AI and not have anyone to build it. You might be a programmer and want to try out your ideas before start writing code. No matter what your coding skill level is, if you want to prototype an application with AI, **Power Platform** and it's **AI Builder** feature is a **fast** and **easy option**. 

This article will explain what is the power platform as well as go through a step by step process to create an app that detects objects from photos using **Power Apps** and **AI Builder.** Read or skip through the questions to learn how to build your first Power App with AI features.
