# How to improve Model performance?

Getting the best model performance for your business can be a rather iterative process. Results can vary depending on the customizations you make to the model, and the training data you provide.

To help facilitate this process, **AI Builder** allows you to have **multiple versions of your model** so you can use your model and continue to improve it at the same time.

### How to share your models?

By default, only you can see the models you create and publish. This feature allows you to test them and use them within apps and flows without exposing them.

If you want others to use your model, you can share it with specific users, groups, or your whole organization.
